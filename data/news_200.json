One recent anti-McGinty ad comes from the Freedom Partners Action Fund, a Republican-leaning PAC involved in Senate races in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Nevada and Indiana. The ad, which Freedom Partners Action Fund backed with $1 million, calls her out for taking jobs related to her past government work, stating, \"she\u2019s made thousands from companies she previously regulated.\" McGinty had several jobs and advisory positions after her work as Secretary of the Department of Environmental Protection in Governor Ed Rendell\u2019s administration.

After leaving Rendell\u2019s administration, according to her LinkedIn profile, McGinty worked as a director for NRG Energy for three years, senior VP and managing director of strategic growth for Weston Solutions for two and chair of Fresh Start PA for five months.

Some believe that trend could get a boost this year due to the short window between Black Friday and Christmas -- 26 days from Thanksgiving to Christmas, down from 32 in 2018. With that backdrop, state Rep. Rob Hutton, R-Brookfield, used the Dec. 4, 2019 GOP weekly radio address to tout his soon-to-be introduced bill to increase the penalties for stealing mail and packages. Hutton started circulating the proposed bill for co-sponsors Dec. 12, 2019. ",

Police departments withhold arrest records and daily logs. A report issued last month by ACCESS/RI found a \"troubling level of non-compliance\" with the state's open records law and called for enhanced oversight by the Attorney General's office. During an interview with Rhode Island Public Radio that aired on Oct. 2, 2014, incumbent Atty. Gen. Peter Kilmartin, a Democrat, was asked about enforcement of the open records law. He lamented that some public bodies are not following the law despite repeated attempts to educate government officials about the documents that are supposed to be public. \"Unfortunately, in the past three years, we have prosecuted or brought more cases on access to public records than in the previous 12 years combined,\" he said. \"That tells me there is still a problem.\"",

        "content": "Not long after President Barack Obama gave a speech outlining his plan for attacking climate change, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., appeared on Fox News to discuss the future of energy and the environment. \"We've had nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s,\" said Wasserman Schultz in a June 28, 2013, interview with Tucker Carlson. \"What that means is that communities like mine in South Florida and coastal communities all across the country are facing dangerous sea-level rise, which will ultimately cause homes to be under water in just a few short years.\" In this item, we won\u2019t analyze her projections for future sea-level rises; such estimates are based on a variety of theoretical models and come with lots of uncertainty attached. However, we did wonder whether Wasserman Schultz was correct about past changes -- specifically, whether South Florida has \"had nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s.\" First, some background on sea-level rises. \"Sea level\" refers to the height of the ocean\u2019s surface as measured either by a mechanical tide gauge (a method used since the 19th century) or, since the late 1990s, by satellite measurements. The kind of changes Wasserman Schultz mentioned are not short-term changes such as high tide and low tide, but rather average sea-level measurements taken over the course of many years.",

The five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council \u2014 China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States \u2014 along with Germany, have until then to strike a deal with the Islamic republic. If all goes the way the United States hopes, a signed agreement will keep Iran out of the nuclear weapons club. For now, the two sides are operating under an interim agreement, which rolls back Iran\u2019s stock of enriched uranium and freezes the country\u2019s capability to produce nuclear materials that could be used to make a nuclear bomb. In exchange, Iran can sell its oil more freely and gain access to millions of dollars in frozen assets. One element that\u2019s fully expected in a long-term arrangement is a limit on the number and kinds of centrifuges Iran can use to enrich uranium. Former CIA deputy director Michael Morell said there\u2019s an irony in that. \"If you are going to have a nuclear weapons program, 5,000 is pretty much the number you need,\" Morell, now a CBS analyst, said on Charlie Rose. \"If you have a power program, you need a lot more.

Clinton, speaking at his presidential center in Little Rock, Ark., on Sept. 4, 2013, said the option to stay on a parent\u2019s policy up to age 26 is a key element of Obama\u2019s law, because it helps keep younger Americans covered. Some young people, presuming they won\u2019t ever get sick, might otherwise be tempted to skip purchasing insurance coverage altogether. Clinton went on to cite data from recent polling by the Commonwealth Fund showing that \"large numbers of young people aged 26 and younger have already enrolled in their parents' plans.

At a Jan. 8 news conference announcing the referendum, Republicans argued the majority of the public \u2014 including in Wisconsin \u2014 supports requiring voters to show their ID before getting a ballot. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said the referendum will allow voters an \"opportunity to give us their final say on something that is supported, if you look at any poll, by 70 to 80% of the public.\" If the referendum fails, Wisconsin\u2019s voter ID law would still remain in place. If passed, it would elevate the law to the state constitution, making it harder for the state Supreme Court to overturn it or future lawmakers to repeal it.",

        "content": "Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott drew heat for a Feb. 4 2014, speech in which he likened official corruption scandals in Texas-Mexico border counties to \"third-world practices,\" a comment PolitiFact Texas unpacked in a Feb. 11 In Context article. His comparison drew criticism from lawmakers, the McAllen newspaper and his main opponent in the governor\u2019s race, Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis, who said, \"Abbott even went as far as comparing the Texas border to a third-world country.\" (Abbott soon after won the Republican gubernatorial nomination in the March 2014 primary.) Responding to such criticism, Abbott said in a Feb. 10 opinion article in the McAllen Monitor that his concerns about corruption expressed in his speech \"apply wherever corruption is found.\" \"Public service is a public trust,\" Abbott wrote. \"As attorney general, I have prosecuted judges, district attorneys and other public officials across Texas who violated that trust, who have been corrupted.\"",

        "content": "Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney\u2019s justification for his proposed sugary drinks tax: soda companies still bring in considerable profits, he says. \"Big soda has a lot of money,\" the mayor argued in an interview with KYW. \"They make a lot of profit off their product and they market in neighborhoods that suffer from these very things that we\u2019re trying to cure.\" Billy Penn has covered how low-income consumers drink more sugary beverages than higher income ones. Advertising is more heavily featured in poor neighborhoods of color, research has shown. So, we decided to look into Kenney\u2019s comment on profits. In the last decade, soda sales have fallen dramatically. In 2014 in the U.S., Coca Cola and Pepsi together sold 1.4 billion cases fewer than they did in 2004, Fortune reported, the sum of \"modest declines\" for 10 years straight. The Philadelphia Inquirer detailed that Coca Cola in particular had lost $1 billion in sales each year since 2012. These drops have meant big changes for Big Soda: Investing in foreign markets, implementing cost-cutting measures, bottling drinks in smaller sizes too for higher profit margins or raising prices altogether, to name a few. Beverage Digest Editor Duane Stanford highlighted price hikes in an interview. \"Companies have increased prices for their products, so they\u2019ve been making money even though they\u2019re selling fewer beverages,\" he said. But! \"Soft drinks are still profitable,\" he continued. Soda corporations \"still have pricing power because their brands are powerful.\"",

In a recent commentary in The Providence Journal, James Aubin, the founder of pro-legalization group Common Sense Citizen, argued for the legalization of  marijuana in Rhode Island, saying it could boost the state\u2019s sagging economy. He included an impressive statistic about the revenue Colorado was bringing in from marijuana sales. \"Colorado raked in $60 million in marijuana taxes and licensing fees in the past year, plus saved most if not all of the $145 million the Harvard report estimated it spent each year fighting marijuana,\" Aubin wrote in the Jan. 5, 2015, piece.",
