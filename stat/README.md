# ðŸ“Š Statistics

This folder stores the statistical analysis results generated after running simulations. It is initially empty and will be populated by outputs from `infstat.py`.

Note that `infstat.py` is not called automatically by the main simulation script. You must run it separately after simulation results are available in the `res/` folder.
